What Works So Far:
1. Web Console button Works
2. Exit Button Works.
3. Start Button Works
4. Stop Button Works
5. Window behaves exactly as it should, i.e, cannot be resized, text field cannot be input to, but otherwise functions, buttons generate predictable signals, etc...

What needs to be done:
1. Code always on top check box
